            <p>E3 Modern is a multi sensory gallery experience, showcasing the work of a diverse group of local Salt Lake City artists, craftsmen, and entrepreneurs. E3 Modern specializes in renting out its unique modern venue for events such as wedding receptions, parties, and business events, as well as providing affordable artist spaces in a central SLC location. Come on in and enjoy sitting in the handcrafted artisan furniture by Sol Adams and listen to the custom built Hi-Fi speaker and vacuum tube audio system by Josh Stippich. You can personally select what music you want to hear by choosing from the vast collection of vintage vinyl, or you can bring any of your own music from home. Prepare to be blown away by the aesthetic beauty and pure, warm sound like nothing youâ€™ve heard before! Take a stroll through the gallery and marvel at the selection of fine art and modern furniture from various local artists. You can also purchase all of your wine, beer & cocktail accessories, gifts, and more from the Boozetique located inside!</p>

            <p>E3 Modern was founded by Josh Stippich, Sol Adams, and Ivonna Earnest. All three are native Utahns who have been involved in the local Salt Lake art and music scene for over 20 years! Sol and Josh learned their passion for audio and art from their father/step-father David Adams who is an artist and audiophile himself. In their younger years they learned welding, finishing, and metal fabrication from David and interned for his business. These skills were the foundation that lead to their business E3 Fabrication which specializes in manufacturing and construction. In the Spring of 2013, E3 Modern was opened to showcase the creative and unique works of Sol, Josh and other local SLC artists to the public. E3 Modern actively supports local Salt Lake city events such as Gallery Stroll, Craft Lake City, the Living Traditions Festival and the Utah Pride Festival. The gallery also supports local artists and entrepreneurs by offering a public venue for people to showcase their work, as well as host events and provide rental spaces for artists in the downtown SLC area.</p> 

            <p>The Boozetique, located inside E3 Modern, is a boutique where you can purchase booze related accessories and gifts including flasks, wine bags, cocktail mixing supplies, and more!  The Boozetique is the brainchild of local independent business owner Ivonna Earnest who has been actively involved with many local SLC independent businesses and artists for many years. The Boozetique was created to bring booze related accessories, gifts, and games to the public after Ivonna realized that no such place existed in SLC. E3 Modern is right next to the State Wine store, making it a convenient place to purchase a diverse array of accoutrements. From cute and quirky cocktail accessories to chic and classy wine bags and aerators, the Boozetique at E3 Modern has everything you need for parties, events, and get togethers!</p>

            <p>E3 Modern has been featured throughout SLC media including City Weekly, Uniquely Utah, Cityhome Collective, Salt Lake Tribune, and SLUG Magazine. Store hours are Monday-Saturday from 11 am to 7 pm.</p>
